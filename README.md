# FEAT
The Farm Energy Analysis Tool (FEAT), a static, deterministic, data-base model, was created to use a whole-farm approach to evaluate energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for different agricultural systems. FEAT simulates farm systems, making it possible to analyze a very large range of possibilities and evaluate their performance under different assumptions.

FEAT is database model that organizes information from the literature in a functional and transparent model that can be used to estimate energy use and GHG emissions from crop production.
